# What is Deep Learning? 

* Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning.
* It involves training artificial neural networks to learn and make decisions. 
* Deep learning algorithms mimic the human brain’s structure and function.

## Neural Networks

* Neural networks are the building blocks of deep learning.
* They consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons.
* With enough training, the network becomes capable of making accurate predictions.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

* CNNs are a type of neural network commonly used in computer vision tasks. 

## Recurrent Neural Networks  (RNNs)

* RNNs are suitable for sequential data processing, such as time series or natural language. 
* RNNs are useful in tasks like speech recognition, machine translation and text generation. 

## Generative Adversarial Networks  (GANs)

* GANs consist of two competing neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. 
* The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish real from fake. 
* GANs are used in generating realistic images, video synthesis, and data augmentation.
